## Methodology

The notebook employs the following methods for customer segmentation:

- KMeans Clustering: This algorithm is used to partition the data into distinct clusters.
- Elbow Method: This method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster center.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and to visualize the clusters in a two-dimensional space.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations and analysis results for the customer segments identified. Key findings and insights are discussed in the notebook. The PCA visualization helps in understanding the distribution of the clusters.
